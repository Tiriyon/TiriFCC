## Lesson 1: Basic HTML and HTML 5

The first lesson is a very simple introductory to the series. 

The first section presents us with the HTML elements, and the first one we encounter is \<h1\> element. Then they proceed to explain that most HTML elements have an opening and closing **tags** (\<\> and \</\>). In this section the simple task of changing \<h1\>Hello\</h1\> to \<h1\>Hello World\</h1\>.

```
<h1>Hello</h1>
```

`main`, `header`, `footer`, `nav`, `video`, `article`, `section`....

These tags give a descriptive structure to your HTML, make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization and accessibility. The `main` HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the main content of your page.

Example usage, a `main` element with two child elements nested inside it:

```
<main>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>Hello Paragraph</p>
</main>
```

**Note:** Many of the new HTML5 tags and their benefits are covered in the Applied Accessibility section.
